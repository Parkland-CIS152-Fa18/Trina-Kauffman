    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
    <h2>Headings Are Great Fun</h2>
    <p>This is my first <strong>paragraph</strong> in my new <em>webpage</em>. This is going to be great. I am so excited I can hardly contain <strong>myself</strong>. Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very useful.</p>
    <h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>
    <p>Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create a webpage is easy and <strong>entertaining</strong>. This is my second <em>paragraph</em>. I hope you like it </p>
    <h2>I Like Candy, Bubblegum & Taffy</h2>
    <p>Just like in ATHF, I would totally eat some <strong>Non-FDA Aapproved. </strong><em>Right next to the gentleman's club.</em></p>
